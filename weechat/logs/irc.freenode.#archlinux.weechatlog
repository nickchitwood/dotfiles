2021-02-07 17:01:52	UnknownEntity42	Hey all, I am trying to create a script for setting the backlight on my thinkpad t14 using the brightness keys in i3-wm the issue I am having is I am trying to do this with the kernel but I cannot echo the /sys/class/backlight/amd_gpu10/brightness file because of permission denied, it is owned by root, so my question is am I going about it the wrong way
2021-02-07 17:01:59	UnknownEntity42	xbacklight doesn't work as its intel only, xrandr was clunky.

2021-02-07 23:31:37	amahl	years ago I have only used old memtest86 that was preinstalled on some distro isos like ubuntu. today I discovered memtest86.com and that they have it all proprietary and the new free version can only do 4 passes

2021-02-07 23:33:13	tsujp	so on macOS you can edit a file called `/etc/synthetic.conf` and get aliases to do stuff like say `/ User/tsujp/Desktop/howdy` which will link `howdy` to `/howdy`. On Linux is a symlink enough to do the same (root to a folder for a user). Of course permissions need to be considered too so I wonder
2021-02-07 23:33:25	tsujp	I am trying to get `/customdirname` as a folder for my Syncthing mount

2021-02-07 23:57:07	promach3	ok, I removed pacman-git
2021-02-07 23:57:11	mpan	amahl: also memtester, though it requires OS running, so it can’t test all memory. The advantage is that you can do partial tests, still quite useful, without stopping the whole environment.
2021-02-07 23:57:23	promach3	and did pacman-key --init   and  pacman-key --populate archlinux
2021-02-07 23:57:33	promach3	Foxboron: but I still have key issue
2021-02-07 23:57:35	promach3	why ?
2021-02-07 23:57:52	promach3	I mean invalid PGP signature
2021-02-07 23:58:32	Foxboron	promach3: the signature is invalid. Messing with the keyring is not needed. The packages can be fetched 404 pages and what not. So check the files in the cache and verify what you got
