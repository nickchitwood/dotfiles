2021-02-07 17:01:52	UnknownEntity42	Hey all, I am trying to create a script for setting the backlight on my thinkpad t14 using the brightness keys in i3-wm the issue I am having is I am trying to do this with the kernel but I cannot echo the /sys/class/backlight/amd_gpu10/brightness file because of permission denied, it is owned by root, so my question is am I going about it the wrong way
2021-02-07 17:01:59	UnknownEntity42	xbacklight doesn't work as its intel only, xrandr was clunky.
