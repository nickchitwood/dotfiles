2021-02-07 17:01:52	UnknownEntity42	Hey all, I am trying to create a script for setting the backlight on my thinkpad t14 using the brightness keys in i3-wm the issue I am having is I am trying to do this with the kernel but I cannot echo the /sys/class/backlight/amd_gpu10/brightness file because of permission denied, it is owned by root, so my question is am I going about it the wrong way
2021-02-07 17:01:59	UnknownEntity42	xbacklight doesn't work as its intel only, xrandr was clunky.

2021-02-07 23:33:13	tsujp	so on macOS you can edit a file called `/etc/synthetic.conf` and get aliases to do stuff like say `/ User/tsujp/Desktop/howdy` which will link `howdy` to `/howdy`. On Linux is a symlink enough to do the same (root to a folder for a user). Of course permissions need to be considered too so I wonder
2021-02-07 23:33:25	tsujp	I am trying to get `/customdirname` as a folder for my Syncthing mount

2021-02-07 23:57:11	mpan	amahl: also memtester, though it requires OS running, so it can’t test all memory. The advantage is that you can do partial tests, still quite useful, without stopping the whole environment.

Only problem, my keyboard layout wont seem to accept UK layouts. Either that or it's gone for the mac version, with the @ being shift 2 instead of the proper key. I was wondering if anyone could point me in the right direction.

I repeatedly query https://archlinux.org/packages/search/json/ but I got invariably rate limited. I was then wondering how to replicate the database sync feature of pacman, and was diving into libalpm source code but I cannot find how the db is sync'd. Does anyone have some pointers?

2021-02-18 05:52:26	mysterybear	but the base URL changed so the patch needs to be applied to every older version doesn't it?
2021-02-18 05:52:54	Repentinus	No, because nobody builds old versions or if they do it is their problem.
2021-02-18 05:52:57	mysterybear	I've left a comment on the AUR repo anyway so hopefully the maintainer will pick it up
2021-02-18 05:53:16	mysterybear	it's the older versions I'm trying to build
2021-02-18 05:53:20	mysterybear	the latest version is fine

2021-02-18 09:13:25	ErnstNeger	Hi, I have a question regarding  autostart: I tried getting guake to autostart by adding it to 'autostart' in gnome-tweaks. This works for one reboot, afterwards it won't autostart anymore. However, if I manually copy guake's .desktop file to /etc/XDG/autostart, it works flawlessly. What is the difference or why doesn't it work using gnome-tweaks?

2021-02-18 13:20:53	GuiToris	if I change that to 1, and reinstall the software, will it undo all my edits? or pacman will complain that something has changed
2021-02-18 13:21:10	NetSysFire	it should just overwrite the file in this case
2021-02-18 13:21:29	morguldir	it will warn you that the file was different as well
2021-02-18 13:21:52	NetSysFire	just make sure you dont get confused when you forget about it by writing it down somewhere
