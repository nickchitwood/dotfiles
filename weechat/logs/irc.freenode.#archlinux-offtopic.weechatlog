2021-02-07 16:36:48	yakubin	second day using a mac: spotlight search got borked and stopped displaying any results. several instances of system encountering some errors without communicating them to the user in any way - the only indication being that core system apps get stuck somewhere. one at a loading animation that never ends. another one at a screen where clicking the main button doesn't do anything. in another 
2021-02-07 16:36:54	yakubin	place UI is clearly borked with text getting out of its container, overflowing border lines etc.
2021-02-07 16:37:13	yakubin	i thought this system was supposed to be user-friendly.
2021-02-07 16:37:43	beest	it is when your name isn't yakubin
2021-02-07 16:37:46	beest	good job breaking it
2021-02-07 16:38:30	yakubin	beest: well. not really. google revealed many instances of spotlight breaking in this exact way.
2021-02-07 16:38:32	beest	although that ui issue is definitely a new one for me
2021-02-07 16:38:49	haavard	yeah honestly I've never heard of any of those and I've used macs for over a decade 
2021-02-07 16:38:59	beest	there are more than a few ways spotlight can get borked but most of them are fixable
2021-02-07 16:39:30	yakubin	i needed to delete the file indexing database and start a new one in the CLI.
2021-02-07 16:39:35	+mpan	yakubin: just come back to Arch.
2021-02-07 16:39:39	yakubin	how is that user-friendly for normal people.
2021-02-07 16:40:04	yakubin	no GUI-based solutions given on the web worked.
2021-02-07 16:40:12	beest	because it's not incredibly common and people only complain loudly when things break
2021-02-07 16:40:26	beest	welcome to every operating system
2021-02-07 16:40:26	+mpan	Simple. There is “an error has occured” message and they send it for repairs. Instead of dealing with some scary wall of errors they do not understand! ;)
2021-02-07 16:40:39	beest	have you seen the shitshow that is linux on the desktop
2021-02-07 16:41:08	yakubin	mpan: that's the point though. there are no error messages anywhere. nothing to go on to diagnose what's wrong.
2021-02-07 16:41:34	+mpan	Even better. You are not frightened by any errors at all! You simply send it for repairs!
2021-02-07 16:41:45	haavard	Yes, and that's perfect 
2021-02-07 16:41:47	beest	yakubin: nothing in the console?
2021-02-07 16:41:50	haavard	No need to deal with shit 
2021-02-07 16:41:56	+mpan	See? Now Mac has no bugs, like those pesky open source apps that display errors!
2021-02-07 16:42:00	haavard	Macs are fantastic honestly 
2021-02-07 16:42:20	beest	lol open source software silently fails constantly
2021-02-07 16:43:02	+mpan	If an exception is thrown in an application and it is swallowed, does anyone see any bugs?
2021-02-07 16:44:24	beest	linux on the desktop is a nightmare and after years and years i finally capitulated and stopped bothering, and i actually know what i'm doing
2021-02-07 16:44:50	yakubin	system preferences and finder are the two most problematic ones. safari e.g. doesn't seem to have any problems.
2021-02-07 16:44:53	beest	unfortunately gnu userspace is starting to show the cracks of a rolling shitshow too
2021-02-07 16:46:16	beest	yakubin: lol the irony there is i don't even use safari anymore since the new edge
2021-02-07 16:46:29	beest	never thought i'd be using bloody microsoft edge on both windows and macos
2021-02-07 16:46:33	e36freak	all software is shit
2021-02-07 16:46:45	+mpan	e36freak: are you saying my programs are shit?!
2021-02-07 16:46:45	yakubin	i'll probably still slowly migrate to mac due to the shitshow of video acceleration on linux. unless i go to windows instead.
2021-02-07 16:46:50	e36freak	mpan: yes.
2021-02-07 16:46:53	e36freak	so are mine
2021-02-07 16:47:00	beest	yakubin: yeah i don't miss that wrestling match
2021-02-07 16:47:06	+mpan	:O
2021-02-07 16:47:10	e36freak	it all depends on what you wanna do with your machine
2021-02-07 16:47:25	e36freak	i think it's great for development and power user kinda stuff. it sucks for gaming and stuff like that

2021-02-07 16:49:10	e36freak	i just... don't wanna give any money to apple

2021-02-07 16:49:36	e36freak	i hate the semi-forced ecosystem
2021-02-07 16:49:49	e36freak	must buy apple products to work with other apple products
2021-02-07 16:49:54	beest	not really
2021-02-07 16:50:01	e36freak	also i think it's overpriced for what you get
2021-02-07 16:50:24	beest	like i said, outside of my audio production macs most of what i do is in a terminal with a nice mixture of bsd and gnu userspace
2021-02-07 16:51:17	beest	as for being overpriced, people seem to get that in their heads because most pc laptops are complete rubbish outside of the handful of similarly-specced-and-priced business pcs
2021-02-07 16:51:23	yakubin	e36freak: mainly, it sucks for scrolling web pages, moving windows too fast, and watching videos in any browser whatsoever.
2021-02-07 16:51:43	yakubin	torn frames, huge delays in rendering, ...
2021-02-07 16:51:58	e36freak	eh, i've never had issues with that
2021-02-07 16:52:28	yakubin	the only time video is reasonable on linux, is in mpv. watch anything in firefox and it just hurts.
2021-02-07 16:52:29	paulguy	i mostly hate how wealthy and powerful they are.
2021-02-07 16:52:46	yakubin	scroll anything in firefox and it hurts.

2021-02-07 16:54:41	yakubin	e36freak: but it really doesn't matter, since the default config in firefox e.g. is to not accelerate those things with the gpu for that. and desktop environments are similar.

2021-02-07 16:59:12	nickybob	Backwards compatibility is an issue
2021-02-07 16:59:32	beest	backwards compatibility is zero issue
2021-02-07 17:00:01	beest	they've done a pretty nice job with the new rosetta
2021-02-07 17:00:07	nickybob	Well, I guess Rosetta is pretty solid. Brew just got a native implementation
2021-02-07 17:00:15	yakubin	yeah. m1 macs are considerably cheaper than the intel ones.

2021-02-07 17:00:57	paulguy	when people get used to the M1 macs, they'll be back to the same price :p
2021-02-07 17:01:55	yakubin	doubtful. the price drop is thanks to removing the margin that intell took for themselves.
2021-02-07 17:02:11	beest	half the point of apple switching from intel in the first place was bringing the price point down
2021-02-07 17:02:34	beest	the other is speed per watt
2021-02-07 17:03:08	beest	even intel apps running through rosetta have been consistently coming out faster than native, at half the power consumption
2021-02-07 17:03:21	beest	s/native/native intel/
2021-02-07 17:04:32	paulguy	i just don't see them keeping the price point much lower than just undercutting the competition forever.
2021-02-07 17:04:50	paulguy	and i don't see intel budging on price. :/
2021-02-07 17:05:07	beest	that's because you're trying to compare apples to oranges
2021-02-07 17:05:23	yakubin	lol.
2021-02-07 17:05:57	beest	until they actually have grown-up arm competition
2021-02-07 17:06:00	paulguy	maybe for some short-term pressure on AMD but intel seem to know what the market will pay for the name.  Apple do as well once people get over the worries of their new architecture.
2021-02-07 17:06:42	beest	lol intel is hemorrhaging market share
2021-02-07 17:06:56	beest	i dunno where you've been
2021-02-07 17:07:10	nickybob	Hey, according to Intel, "Intel also claims that the i7-1185G7 is six times faster than M1 on AI-tools from Topaz Labs and Adobe Premiere, Photoshop and Lightroom functions". Of course, those tools are optimized to use Intel specific instructions. 
2021-02-07 17:07:34	beest	and also probably uses 20 times more power
2021-02-07 17:08:44	beest	modern i7s are hangry
2021-02-07 17:10:39	beest	not to mention that apple's graphics hardware is supposed to smoke modern iris, but i haven't seen it benched or tried
2021-02-07 17:11:43	paulguy	i'd hope that they're relying on more speical purpose hardware for getting photo and video editing performance on par.

2021-02-07 17:12:56	beest	they have got tdp on the 1185g7 down a fair bit though
2021-02-07 17:13:11	beest	the spec is 28W
2021-02-07 17:13:55	paulguy	but yeah intel have been quite sloppy recently, kinda playing the pentium 4 game of cranking up power to compensate for architectural shortcomings
2021-02-07 17:14:37	paulguy	still, market value is market value and i dunno if Apple would really want to devalue their product unless they're confident they can compensate with sales.
2021-02-07 17:15:12	Hello72	beest: although knowing them, that's through (more) cheating on the definition of tdp
2021-02-07 17:15:28	paulguy	i'm just thinking that now they're in a position where they have to prove the value of their new product
2021-02-07 17:16:49	paulguy	yeah, TDP measurements are barely comparable across brands of CPU.  it's just based on arbitrary factors defined by the manufacturer.

2021-02-07 17:34:15	mnrmnaugh	ah hmmm
2021-02-07 17:34:33	+mpan	Friithian: TDP = Thermal Design Power, not Top Dissipated Power.
2021-02-07 17:34:39	Friithian	I know
2021-02-07 17:34:58	mnrmnaugh	i was wondering why my freinds car was here
2021-02-07 17:35:01	Friithian	it is designed for 65W normally, but Ive overclocked it in such a way so it pulls a lot more than that
2021-02-07 17:35:13	+mpan	TDP means that as long as the cooling can reasonably fast remove TDP watts, the CPU is expected to be stable and safe.
2021-02-07 17:35:20	mnrmnaugh	Friithian� make uber have cars available

2021-02-07 17:36:12	Friithian	I wouldnt want to drive in snow unless I had to
2021-02-07 17:36:19	+mpan	With TDP not being standardized and every manufacturer posting whatever value they want without offering information on testing methodology, the value is often useless — except pehaps comparing CPUs of the same generation and same producer.
2021-02-07 17:36:29	mnrmnaugh	Friithian� but you can win pretty shiney coins!
2021-02-07 17:36:36	Friithian	mpan you keep explainin- wait ive said this already
2021-02-07 17:36:51	Friithian	mnrmnaugh: but are shiney coins worth the potential danger?
2021-02-07 17:37:13	mnrmnaugh	Friithian� according to society, yes

2021-02-07 18:27:21	e36freak	like a G
2021-02-07 18:27:21	kevr	basically, just mortar the legs together, then have one brick on top and beneath the wood piece, drill screws straight up into that with some mortar as well
2021-02-07 18:27:27	mnrmnaugh	lol e36freak 
2021-02-07 18:27:30	kevr	then use a weight on top to make sure it secures down

2021-02-07 18:37:09	Friithian	ah fun, trying to get skyrim to work with SKSE. Skyrim: you can get it on every single platform including your toaster, but god forbit you want it native on linux
2021-02-07 18:37:19	e36freak	mnrmnaugh: ah man, i haven't seen openbox in ages
2021-02-07 18:37:24	e36freak	you've been using that for a while, iirc
2021-02-07 18:37:26	mnrmnaugh	e36freak� lol hijacking buttons like minimize to opeen a menu
2021-02-07 18:37:36	kevr	ive got sandpaper too, so im probably gonna spend several days sanding everything down to look clean
2021-02-07 18:37:41	kevr	some 150 grit
2021-02-07 18:37:44	mnrmnaugh	ye, because xfwm broke like a year ago
2021-02-07 18:37:44	e36freak	stain?
2021-02-07 18:37:49	e36freak	ah
2021-02-07 18:37:54	e36freak	still love my tilers
2021-02-07 18:38:10	mnrmnaugh	i use panning as well
2021-02-07 18:38:19	e36freak	have no idea what that is
2021-02-07 18:38:25	mnrmnaugh	e36freak� my mouse broke and i hit pts/103
2021-02-07 18:38:37	e36freak	kevr: do you have experience sanding/wood working?
2021-02-07 18:38:43	kevr	i do not.
2021-02-07 18:38:50	e36freak	start with the rough stuff and work your way up, and alternate directions each time
2021-02-07 18:38:53	kevr	i'm very inexperienced with most real world things.
2021-02-07 18:39:00	e36freak	like 90 degrees off each time you step it up
2021-02-07 18:39:04	mnrmnaugh	e36freak� like in starcraft, when you mouse at the edge of the screen, and the viewport moves. x can do that
2021-02-07 18:39:09	kevr	ok
2021-02-07 18:39:10	e36freak	that way you can easily see the scratches from the previous grit
2021-02-07 18:39:10	kevr	will do!
2021-02-07 18:39:17	e36freak	and know when you get them all
2021-02-07 18:39:17	mnrmnaugh	kevr� ask miro about sanding lol
2021-02-07 18:39:47	e36freak	depending on the wood you're starting with, probably start with 80ish grit and work your way up to around a 220 and that should be good for staining or sealing
2021-02-07 18:39:48	mnrmnaugh	mr "im gonna make my own belts"
2021-02-07 18:39:54	mnrmnaugh	miro++
2021-02-07 18:40:11	mnrmnaugh	ye what e36freak said
2021-02-07 18:40:11	kevr	e36freak: the only reason i was going to sand to start off with was just to smooth some things out
2021-02-07 18:40:24	kevr	there are parts of the wood that have sharp edges, i just wanna dull them out
2021-02-07 18:40:26	kevr	clean em up
2021-02-07 18:40:27	e36freak	urethane is a bitch to keep from getting bubbles, i dunno how you plan on finishing it
2021-02-07 18:40:46	mnrmnaugh	wood glue makes a decent varnish
2021-02-07 18:40:53	e36freak	kevr: i'd do that with like an 80 and it's worth working your way up
2021-02-07 18:40:57	mnrmnaugh	looks like shit, but, hey, no splinters
2021-02-07 18:40:58	e36freak	the results will be worth the effort
2021-02-07 18:41:04	kevr	i'll have to get some more from my brother, then
2021-02-07 18:41:08	kevr	i only picked up 150 grit
2021-02-07 18:41:13	e36freak	get a 2x4 or something and staple the sandpaper to it to make a sanding block
2021-02-07 18:41:23	e36freak	may easier on the hands than trying to use bare paper
2021-02-07 18:41:24	kevr	ah good idea
2021-02-07 18:41:32	mnrmnaugh	kevr� you want to change grades so you arent sanding all day
2021-02-07 18:41:37	<--	kcrow (~l33t@unaffiliated/nuerewt) has quit (Quit: No Ping reply in 180 seconds.)
2021-02-07 18:42:07	kevr	makes sense, lower grit for depth, higher grit to smooth out what i made deeper
2021-02-07 18:42:08	Friithian	ok, got SKSE working, now time to run from the guards who want me dead for uh, murdering a few people
2021-02-07 18:42:09	kevr	yea?
2021-02-07 18:42:27	mnrmnaugh	er, not deeper?
2021-02-07 18:42:35	mnrmnaugh	like "not deeper"
2021-02-07 18:43:04	mnrmnaugh	sanding removes high points, like any abrasive surfacing process
2021-02-07 18:43:04	kevr	i imagine i would just use lower grit to speed up the process because it cuts more into it
2021-02-07 18:43:15	mnrmnaugh	ye
2021-02-07 18:43:18	kevr	k
2021-02-07 18:43:28	e36freak	yeah it would take forever if you started at a high grit
2021-02-07 18:43:54	Friithian	try to sand something down starting with 2500
2021-02-07 18:44:07	mnrmnaugh	lol just use a cast iron frying pan
2021-02-07 18:44:26	kevr	i'll get started on it in a few days. i just gotta find some really affordable low quantity of mortar
2021-02-07 18:44:41	mnrmnaugh	i have a set of these sweet arse sharpstones
2021-02-07 18:44:48	e36freak	do you have a trowel?
2021-02-07 18:44:55	kevr	the only mortar i could find at home depot was like $20 bags of 10lb mortar mix
2021-02-07 18:45:04	kevr	a trowel... no
2021-02-07 18:45:27	kevr	oh, that
2021-02-07 18:45:31	kevr	i'll get one, no worries

2021-02-07 18:45:44	e36freak	mortar in general is cheap
2021-02-07 18:45:57	mnrmnaugh	e36freak� the load builds up in the hole bits
2021-02-07 18:46:01	kevr	yeah. it is cheap, i just don't need 10 lbs of it
2021-02-07 18:46:17	kevr	worst case scenario, i just get a 10lb bag and have some for later
2021-02-07 18:46:24	kevr	but i'd like to just get a few lbs if possible
2021-02-07 18:47:06	e36freak	shit, home depot has an 80 lb bag for $6
2021-02-07 18:47:19	kevr	o.o
2021-02-07 18:47:21	kevr	wut
2021-02-07 18:47:22	paulguy	my butt has a crack in it

2021-02-07 18:47:38	kevr	but fuck, if they have that, i'll just get that.
2021-02-07 18:47:40	mnrmnaugh	kevr� ye, it is crushed limestone

2021-02-07 18:48:18	kevr	yeah, you have to. any reasonable priced mortar just comes with the mortar mix
2021-02-07 18:48:20	e36freak	seems to good to be true
2021-02-07 18:48:23	kevr	then you mix it up

2021-02-07 18:49:48	kevr	yeah
2021-02-07 18:49:53	paulguy	they'll just tell me to take an allergy medication
2021-02-07 18:50:01	kevr	what if it's malaria instead
2021-02-07 18:50:03	kevr	and you die
2021-02-07 18:50:07	kevr	what if that?

2021-02-07 18:51:05	e36freak	paulguy: ...it's winter
2021-02-07 18:51:14	NetSysFire	you are constantly complaining how sick you are but dont want to go to a doctor
2021-02-07 18:51:19	paulguy	it only started being winter like a week ago
2021-02-07 18:51:38	paulguy	also all my other ailments are basically better.
2021-02-07 18:51:51	e36freak	kevr: what wood are you using? just ply?
2021-02-07 18:51:52	NetSysFire	you mentioned that you dont like doctors but if you are literally sick for weeks it doesnt look like "just a throat itch"
2021-02-07 18:52:04	e36freak	yeahhhh
2021-02-07 18:52:06	mnrmnaugh	ew plywood shelves

2021-02-07 18:53:09	e36freak	just gotta do something with the edges

2021-02-07 18:54:14	kevr	e36freak: i believe so.
2021-02-07 18:54:32	kevr	i'm derping right now, i didn't even think it mattered that much at the time so i didn't pay attention at all to what it was
2021-02-07 18:54:41	kevr	but it's lighter, looks like plywood
2021-02-07 18:54:59	kevr	of course it matters, but eh, i had the selections that they had
2021-02-07 18:55:03	e36freak	i mean ply is fine depending on the grade. the edges won't look great unless you put a veneer on it
2021-02-07 18:55:29	mnrmnaugh	e36freak� it takes like all fucking week to hone down a board with an adz... i only did it once, but fuck
2021-02-07 18:55:48	e36freak	mnrmnaugh: i bet
2021-02-07 18:56:06	e36freak	mnrmnaugh: i shaped a knife out of 1095 once with only hand files. that shit took forever
