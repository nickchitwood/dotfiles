2021-02-07 16:44:07	Borley	hmm actually ibus-daemon: Gtk-WARNING ** cannot open display :0
2021-02-07 16:44:17	Borley	it may not be looking for the right display server
2021-02-07 16:45:26	Arnavion	Last I checked, either ibus or sway didn't support the relevant wayland IME protocol anyway

2021-02-07 16:48:06	Borley	I have no particular loyalty to ibus, maybe fcitx can work
2021-02-07 16:48:26	Arnavion	Yes, fcitx works fine, albeit via toolkit env vars rather than any compositor integration
2021-02-07 16:49:17	Arnavion	ie set GTK_IM_MODULE and QT_IM_MODULE env vars before starting sway

2021-02-07 17:50:24	epsilonKNOT	i dunno if this is the place to ask for help about waybar but I dont think theres a waybar channel
2021-02-07 17:51:24	epsilonKNOT	I'm currently having an issue where I'm getting the weird boxes in waybar when I visit youtube, with the error - (waybar:30259): Pango-WARNING **: 20:49:25.991: Invalid UTF-8 string passed to pango_layout_set_text()

2021-02-07 17:58:12	fluix	oh, you mention "weird boxes", those are emojis that your font doesn't have glyphs for

2021-02-07 18:01:40	epsilonKNOT	or maybe... let me try again

2021-02-07 18:23:48	wgwz	is it possible to try out sway on manjaro?
2021-02-07 18:26:14	Arnavion	epsilonKNOT: fluix: If there's a pango warning about invalid utf-8 then those boxes are the replacement character glyph, not something a font will solve
2021-02-07 18:26:50	epsilonKNOT	O-O
2021-02-07 18:27:24	epsilonKNOT	Arnavion: i only vaguely heard about this, could you dumb it down plz?
2021-02-07 18:29:27	Arnavion	waybar thinks the window title is utf-8. Firefox apparently begs to differ
2021-02-07 18:29:47	epsilonKNOT	Ah
2021-02-07 18:29:57	epsilonKNOT	ok, this is not good then
2021-02-07 18:30:25	Arnavion	I assume sway just passes it through as an opaque char* rather than interpreting it or transforming the encoding in any way, but I don't know
2021-02-07 18:31:06	Arnavion	Looking at what `swaymsg -t get_tree` says might give a clue, though even that introduces more moving parts into the process (JSON serializer) so who knows
2021-02-07 18:31:40	epsilonKNOT	this is on wayfire, but the bug itself sounds like either a firefox or windows bug
