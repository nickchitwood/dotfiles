2021-02-07 16:49:17	Arnavion	ie set GTK_IM_MODULE and QT_IM_MODULE env vars before starting sway

2021-02-07 18:29:47	epsilonKNOT	Ah
2021-02-07 18:29:57	epsilonKNOT	ok, this is not good then
2021-02-07 18:30:25	Arnavion	I assume sway just passes it through as an opaque char* rather than interpreting it or transforming the encoding in any way, but I don't know
2021-02-07 18:31:06	Arnavion	Looking at what `swaymsg -t get_tree` says might give a clue, though even that introduces more moving parts into the process (JSON serializer) so who knows

2021-02-18 05:58:02	kennylevinsen	of course it's not good that the kernel freezes. But kernel bugs are fixed in the kernel. Sway and xwayland isn't doing anything wrong. If the problem was well understood, rampant and affecting many users without the ability to avoid it and with no fix in sight, and a workaround in xwayland or sway was possible, that could be considered for temporary implementation...
2021-02-18 05:59:41	wb9688	tsdh: I do have that import environment stuff though (and I am using logind)
2021-02-18 06:00:37	kennylevinsen	wb9688: check journalctl, maybe what is being activated is crashing. Kinda sounds like it.
2021-02-18 06:02:45	wb9688	kennylevinsen: Thanks for the hint as it does seem to be "cannot open display:" then :/
2021-02-18 06:04:13	kennylevinsen	that suggests things aren't importing right. Try to run the import-environment from a terminal. As with everything systemd, it's picky, and has arbitrary restrictions of what can be in the environment for it not to fail.

2021-02-18 12:50:28	abercoo234	is there a way to disable whatever wayland protocol allows one application to spy on the pixels of another?
2021-02-18 12:51:18	abercoo234	and are there any other dangerous protocols like this? such as input spying?

2021-02-18 12:53:53	marvinXP	On my keyboard issue though. Does anyone have any ideas why my xkb_file would not quite work for apps going via xwayland? Is there someplace else I should ask where I may have more luck? https://superuser.com/questions/1626824/how-do-i-get-xkb-settings-to-work-via-xwayland-they-work-fine-when-used-on-wayl

2021-02-18 13:48:33	sunyibo	pinyin is a phonetic way to input chinese characters. It's fairly straightforward to set up on gnome, but on sway it's messy. I didn't find good documentation, just people complaining that it doesn't work. I can type now with fcitx5 in a text editor, but not on the duolingo website
