2021-02-07 16:44:17	Borley	it may not be looking for the right display server
2021-02-07 16:45:26	Arnavion	Last I checked, either ibus or sway didn't support the relevant wayland IME protocol anyway

2021-02-07 16:48:06	Borley	I have no particular loyalty to ibus, maybe fcitx can work
2021-02-07 16:48:26	Arnavion	Yes, fcitx works fine, albeit via toolkit env vars rather than any compositor integration
2021-02-07 16:49:17	Arnavion	ie set GTK_IM_MODULE and QT_IM_MODULE env vars before starting sway

2021-02-07 18:26:14	Arnavion	epsilonKNOT: fluix: If there's a pango warning about invalid utf-8 then those boxes are the replacement character glyph, not something a font will solve

2021-02-07 18:27:24	epsilonKNOT	Arnavion: i only vaguely heard about this, could you dumb it down plz?
2021-02-07 18:29:27	Arnavion	waybar thinks the window title is utf-8. Firefox apparently begs to differ
2021-02-07 18:29:47	epsilonKNOT	Ah
2021-02-07 18:29:57	epsilonKNOT	ok, this is not good then
2021-02-07 18:30:25	Arnavion	I assume sway just passes it through as an opaque char* rather than interpreting it or transforming the encoding in any way, but I don't know
2021-02-07 18:31:06	Arnavion	Looking at what `swaymsg -t get_tree` says might give a clue, though even that introduces more moving parts into the process (JSON serializer) so who knows
2021-02-07 18:31:40	epsilonKNOT	this is on wayfire, but the bug itself sounds like either a firefox or windows bug

2021-02-07 23:55:25	Arnavion	siceloa: Yes, swaybar has virtual identical code and exactly the same omission - it only uses surface_{x,y} in the motion callback, not the enter callback. So it needs the same fix
